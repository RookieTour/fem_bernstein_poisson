first iteration of a finite element simulation on a rectangle

using arbitary degree bernstein polynomials and analytical integration for computation of stiffnes matrix factors

makefile has yet to be tested *missing include of cusparse library*

to do:
- include dirichlet boundary conditions apliance fpr CSR type matrix

- solve system of ecquations with CG-method using cusparse matrix-vector / vector-vector product

- sort output vector
